## Pre Cohort/Prep


# Hello everyone! 
My name is Diego Hernandez and I will be your instructor for this bootcamp ðŸ˜Š. I am very excited to meet everyone and guide your through this journey. Before class starts, I would like to share some thoughts and resources so you may be better prepaired for the curriculum. First off, *books* ðŸ˜±

## Books

I know, you are here to do cool stuff on the web though I know that reading has helped me tremendously on my journey as a developer. So here are some recommendations based off commom traits/personailities I see in class

### I can struggle to stay consistent or even get started

> `Atomic Habbits` by *James Clear*
This book offers a straightforward system for lasting change. Clear's focus on tiny, incremental improvements empowers you to build better habits through small, sustainable actions.  This book provides a practical and inspiring roadmap for personal transformation.
A good alternative that is a little shorter is `The Compound Effect` by *Darren Hardy

### I can struggle staying organized with eveyrthing I have to do in my life

> `Building a Second Brain` by *Tiago Forte*
This book is a practical method to manage your knowledge. The book presents a structured system to store and organize your ideas, notes, and important information digitally. This approach can help you clear mental clutter, easily reference valuable insights, and boost your productivity.

### I can feel stuck and get the sense I can't learn/do things well
> `Mindset` by *Carol Dweck*
This book investigates the impact our beliefs about our abilities have on our lives.  Dweck explains the difference between fixed and growth mindsets, showing how a growth mindset can lead to greater success and fulfillment.

### I can feel as if I can get through by doing just enough to pass

> `The 10X Rule` by *Grant Cardone*
This book offers a framework for setting ambitious goals and taking consistent, focused action.  It encourages you to think bigger about what you can achieve and emphasizes the importance of significant effort. If you're looking for a way to push beyond your current limits, this book might provide the motivation you need.

If you have the means to read any of these, I highly encourage it. Even if it means going to the library ðŸ˜±. Though even a YouTube recap will help!

## Staying organzied 

It is a good time to start thinking about how you will take notes and store resources. You will be learning a lot of new things in a short period of time. It is important to have a good place to keep track of everything that makes sense to you, be it in Apple Notes, Google Keep, a spreadsheet, or good old pen and paper. Find something that makes sense for you.
I generally recommend [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product). It is what I use for teaching, work, and projects though it comes with a learning curve. Thankfully there are plenty of templates that can get you started with no settup.
